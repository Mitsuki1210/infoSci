1. What did we do?
We did an activity of making Dr. Ruben make a jam sandwich. Each step was taken seriously and one lacking part or vague information would make the step not work

1. What did you learn?
I learned that making the steps to vague or to specific leads to a problem in the program.

1. What questions do I have?
I want to learn how to judge what the information that needs to be told is and how you can give percise information in the program

2. What did we do?
We made circles and squares with a code that would allow us to use a dice on our computer. 

2. What did you learn?
I learned how to make squares with curved edges, circles, and how to use the if to make the dice function

2. What questions do I have?
I want to be able to do the programming more quickly so I can make more complex patters (How I can achieve this?)
