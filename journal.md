1. What did we do?
We did an activity of making Dr. Ruben make a jam sandwich. Each step was taken seriously and one lacking part or vague information would make the step not work

1. What did you learn?
I learned that making the steps to vague or to specific leads to a problem in the program.

1. What questions do I have?
I want to learn how to judge what the information that needs to be told is and how you can give percise information in the program
